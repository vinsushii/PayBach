                  <p>As provided in Section 17.4 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act 9184, bidders may be asked to pay for bidding documents to recover the cost of their preparation and development. The BAC shall issue the bidding documents to the prospective bidder/s upon payment of the corresponding cost thereof to the collecting/disbursing officer of the procuring entity concerned.</p>

                  <p class="fw-bold">2. PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>These guidelines are formulated to provide standard rates for the sale of bidding documents to rationalize the fees primarily to regulate its price and to lessen the exercise of discretion of procuring entities so as not to discourage market participation and competition.</p>

                  <p class="fw-bold">3. SCOPE AND APPLICATION</p>
                  <p>These guidelines shall apply to the national government, its branches, constitutional offices, departments, bureaus, offices and agencies, including state universities and colleges, government-owned and/or -controlled corporations, government financial institutions, and local government units.</p>
